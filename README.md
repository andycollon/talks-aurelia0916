The picture puzzle game i made for the aurelia presentation at JavaScript NorthWest

There are two versions for windows and mac (in the win and mac folders)
I was having an issue with just porting the directories between os's so au new'd them individually

If you'd like to have a look just get them to your drive and npm install the packages then "au run" from the win/mac folders

"au run" is the aurelia cli command to run the site
You can use "au run --watch" to have aurelia watch for changes and rebuild
